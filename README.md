# Data Structures

Please note that this repository's purpose is to practice programming
different programming languages. The data structures will be chosen
arbitrarily, and I may very well not implement all features or
structures in all languages I choose to practice.

Planned data structures are:

- Linked lists
- Binary search trees
  - Unbalanced
  - AVL trees
  - Red-black trees
- Priority queues
  - Binary heaps
  - Leftist heaps
  - Binomial heaps
  - Pairing heaps
- Disjunct sets
- Graphs

# Languages

Planned languages are:

- Java
- C
- Scala
- JavaScript

## Java

The following data structures have been implemented in Java:

- Linked list

# Notes

I may add more data structures and languages over
time. Implementations may vary depending on the features of a
language. For instance I will try to ensure Scala implementations are
immutable to fit the functional paradigm, while a Java implementation
will almost certainly be mutable.
